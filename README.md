# 1. Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment using Machine Learning Models

## Overview

This project focuses on predictive maintenance for industrial equipment using machine learning models. Leveraging a predictive maintenance dataset sourced from Kaggle, the project aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of equipment by predicting potential failures before they occur.

## Models Implemented

- **Decision Tree**: Achieved the highest accuracy of 98.95%, making it the top-performing model for this task.
- **Random Forest**: Achieved an accuracy of 98.40%, closely following the Decision Tree model.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** : Achieved an accuracy of 97.89
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** : Achieved an accuracy of 97.69
- **Logistic Regression** : Achieved an accuracy of 97.39

Each model was evaluated and compared to determine its effectiveness in predicting equipment failures.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, feature selection, normalization and visualisation.
- **Model Training**: Implementation and training of various machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using accuracy and other metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive visualizations to understand data distributions and model predictions.
  
## Results

- **Top Model Accuracy**: Decision Tree (98.95%)
- **Second Best Accuracy**: Random Forest (98.40%)
